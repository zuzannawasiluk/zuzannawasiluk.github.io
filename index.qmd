Hello! I'm Zuzanna (pronounced Zoo-z-anna) and I am currently studying Economics, Statistics, and Data Science at St. Olaf College. For my fall semester I have Data Science 2, Statistics 2, Econometrics: Time Series and Forecasting, Politics and Development, Rock Climbing, and an academic internship at the Northfield History Center for my classes.  

Thank you for taking the time to look at some of my work. Enjoy!
